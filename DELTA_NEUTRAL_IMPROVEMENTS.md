# Delta-Neutral Strategy Feature Enhancements

This document outlines the roadmap for new features and improvements to enhance the delta-neutral strategy monitoring capabilities of the application. The roadmap is divided into three phases, aligned with the project's long-term vision.

## Phase 1: Critical Features (Immediate Priority)

### 1. Funding Rate Analytics Card
*   **Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-10-07)
*   **Description:** Provide a comprehensive overview of funding rate analytics, including current APR, 8-hour trend chart, estimated daily/monthly revenue, and comparison with the 7-day average.

### 2. Liquidation Risk Monitor Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Visualize the safe buffer zone for liquidation, provide price alert thresholds, estimate time to liquidation based on volatility, and recommend margin adjustments to maintain a safe threshold.

### 3. Auto-Close Recommendations Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Provide automated recommendations to HOLD, MONITOR, or CLOSE a position based on a set of predefined triggers, such as funding rate thresholds, liquidation distance, and net gain targets.

## Phase 2: High-Value Features

### 4. ROI & Break-Even Analysis Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Calculate and display the Net ROI, daily/monthly ROI, break-even point in days, and the effective APR after all fees. This will provide a clearer picture of the profitability of each position.

### 5. Position Health Score Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Develop a composite health score (0-100) for each position based on liquidation distance, delta neutrality, funding rate trend, and net gain. This will provide a quick and easy way to assess the risk of each position.

### 6. Funding vs. Unrealized PnL Comparison
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Visualize the relationship between funding earned and unrealized P&L from price movements. This will help users understand the trade-offs between funding income and price risk.

## Phase 3: Optimization Features

### 7. Delta Imbalance Impact Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Quantify the impact of delta imbalance in USD, simulate the P&L impact of price movements, and estimate the cost of rebalancing. This will help users make more informed decisions about when and how to rebalance their positions.

### 8. Fee Breakdown & Optimization Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Provide a detailed breakdown of fees, calculate the fee efficiency ratio, and offer tips for optimizing fee expenditures. This will help users minimize their trading costs and maximize their net returns.

### 9. Cross-Position Portfolio Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Provide a portfolio-level view of all delta-neutral positions, including total exposure, average funding rate, and portfolio net gain. This will help users manage their overall risk and diversification.

### 10. Historical Performance Card
*   **Status:** ⏳ Planned
*   **Description:** Track and display the historical performance of the delta-neutral strategy, including cumulative funding revenue, monthly P&L breakdown, and success rate. This will help users learn from their past trades and improve their strategy over time.
