# Perpetual Connector Specification Workstream

## Overview
This document seeds the connector workstream for onboarding new perpetual venues into the delta-neutral scouting engine. It captures required capabilities, data sourcing, and open questions for each prioritized venue.

### Shared Requirements
- **Core metrics**: mark price, funding rate (current + annualized), open interest, taker/maker fees, min tick/size.
- **Liquidity context**: order book depth (top 5 levels), 24h volume, available leverage tiers, margin asset.
- **Risk telemetry**: liquidation thresholds, maintenance margin, insurance fund status, API health.
- **Frequency**: funding snapshot every 1m, order book depth every 10s, metadata refresh every 10m.
- **Transport**: prefer WebSocket streaming; fall back to REST polling with rate limit guardrails.
- **Outputs**: standardized JSON payload consumed by `perpAdapters/*` with schema versioning and completeness flags.

---

## Aster
- **API**: REST (`https://api.asterdex.com/v1/perp/*`), WebSocket for book updates.
- **Auth**: API key (read-only) requested via support desk.
- **Endpoints to confirm**:
  - `GET /funding/history?symbol=` for 7/30/90-day funding.
  - `GET /markets` for tick sizes, leverage tiers, fee schedule.
  - WebSocket `@bookTicker` / `@depth` streams.
- **Data gaps**: need clarity on hidden-order liquidity visibility and yield-bearing margin exposure.
- **Action items**:
  1. âœ… Request sandbox API key (stored as env `ASTER_API_KEY` / `ASTER_SECRET_KEY`).
  2. Capture 24h funding sample for top 10 pairs and validate against DefiLlama metrics.
  3. Document throttling rules and fallback plan.

## Avantis
- **API**: GraphQL (`https://api.avantisfi.com/graphql`) + REST for trades; on-chain access via Base RPC for the Trader SDK.
- **Auth**:
  - **Trader SDK**: no Avantis-issued key required. Provide your own Base RPC (`provider_url`) and optional WebSocket feed URL (per [Avantis Trader SDK docs](https://sdk.avantisfi.com/)).
  - **GraphQL/REST analytics**: request read-only API key if higher rate limits or non-public datasets are needed.
- **Queries**:
  - `perpMarkets` for metadata.
  - `fundingRates` with time range.
  - `liquiditySnapshots` for depth + TVL.
- **Action items**:
  1. Define GraphQL fragments for scouting needs.
  2. Confirm Base network RPC requirements for on-chain verification.
  3. Document when to escalate for an Avantis API key (only if analytics endpoints require it).

## Jupiter Perps
- **API**: gRPC/WebSocket via Jupiter aggregator.
- **Auth**: public, rate-limited.
- **Data focus**:
  - Funding and borrow once SDK exposes endpoints (track `@jup-ag/lend` updates).
  - Order flow share metrics for cross-venue routing signal.
- **Action items**:
  1. Monitor SDK changelog for borrow support.
  2. Prototype Solana WebSocket client with backpressure handling.

## SynFutures v3
- **API**: REST + GraphQL hybrid; permissionless market listings.
- **Auth**: public.
- **Key needs**:
  - Funding calc when synthetic oracle deviates (Pyth vs. Chainlink).
  - Market discovery for long-tail pairs (auto ingestion).
- **Action items**:
  1. Determine cadence for market discovery job (hourly vs. daily).
  2. Validate funding calculation for custom markets.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Connector Checklist**: authenticate, pull static metadata, stream real-time data, handle failover, and emit standardized payload.
2. **Mock Data Sets**: 24h rolling JSON snapshots per venue for frontend prototyping.
3. **Telemetry Hooks**: ensure each connector reports rate limit status, last successful update, and data freshness SLA.

## Timeline (Draft)
- Week 1: Secure API keys/access, finalize schema, build mock feeds.
- Week 2: Implement adapters for Aster and Avantis; start integration tests.
- Week 3: Add SynFutures connector, integrate telemetry, backfill historical funding.
- Week 4: QA + documentation, handoff to UI team for live data integration.

## Week 1 Progress

| Venue          | Access Status | Notes                                                                                       | Owner    |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Aster          | Received      | API key + secret stored as `ASTER_API_KEY` / `ASTER_SECRET_KEY` in backend `.env`; ready for sandbox pulls. | Platform |
| Avantis        | Pending       | GraphQL key request emailed; schema fragments outlined in `mocks/perp_feeds/sample_feeds.json`. | Platform |
| Jupiter Perps  | Public        | No key required; waiting on SDK borrow endpoints.                                          | Research |
| SynFutures v3  | Public        | Public endpoints OK; confirming funding calc for custom markets.                           | Research |

### Mock Feed Checklist
- [x] Create baseline JSON payload (`mocks/perp_feeds/sample_feeds.json`) to validate adapter schema.
- [ ] Replace sample values with live pulls once API keys arrive.
- [ ] Add venue-specific fixtures when connectors emit first real snapshots.

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Submit/track API key requests for Aster and Avantis (owner: Platform).
2. Prototype Solana WebSocket client against Jupiter public feed to ensure backpressure strategy.
3. Validate funding calculation formula for SynFutures synthetic markets using sample payload.

### API Integration Checkpoint
- New backend endpoint: `GET /api/perp-connectors?mode={auto|live|mock}`
  - `auto` (default) attempts live data and falls back to mock snapshots.
  - `mode=mock` forces usage of the sample payload located at `mocks/perp_feeds/sample_feeds.json`.
  - Response includes connector metadata, market listings, and a summary payload for UI consumers.
- Rate limiting guardrails: connector results are cached for `PERP_CONNECTOR_LIVE_TTL_MS` (default 60s) when live data is healthy, and for `PERP_CONNECTOR_MOCK_TTL_MS` (default 10s) when the system falls back to mock data. Adjust these env vars if venue quotas mandate longer or shorter refresh cycles.

### Reference Rate Limits (initial research)
- **Aster**: public documentation does not publish hard caps; support suggests staying below 60 requests/min per API key. Caching window currently set to 60 seconds to comply.
- **Avantis**: SDK primarily hits Base RPC; GraphQL endpoint limits are not documented. Default 60-second cache avoids unnecessary polling until official guidance is received.
- **Jupiter Perps**: aggregator endpoints are open but subject to undisclosed rate limits; community guidance recommends <30 req/min. Cached responses reduce load.
- **SynFutures v3**: REST endpoints are public with soft rate limits (community reports ~120 req/min). Current caching is sufficient; revisit once production traffic patterns are known.
