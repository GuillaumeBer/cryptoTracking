# jupiter-perps-anchor-idl-parsing

This repo contains samples on parsing the Jupiter Perpetuals IDL and fetching or interacting with the perpetuals and JLP pool data. The examples are contained in the `src/examples` directory with comments on how each function works.

This repo should be used in conjunction with the station guides to better understand how the code snippets work:
